# Employee Management System (EM_PROJECT)

## Overview

**Employee Management System** is a simple yet effective CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using **React.js**. This project serves as a basic implementation of managing employee records, allowing users to perform essential operations on employee data through a user-friendly interface. Built using functional components and React hooks, the application demonstrates core React principles and state management techniques.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Backend Integration**: Connected with a backend API for persistent data storage.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Hooks**: Manage state and lifecycle in functional components
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the application
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core scripting language for the application
